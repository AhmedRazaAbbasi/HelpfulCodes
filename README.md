## Steps For Contribution.
### Step 1:
Give Star and Fork this repository.
### Step 2: Fork this repository
You can fork this repository by clicking on fork button on top right corner. Once you fork this will create a copy of repository on your account.
### Step 3: Clone the repository 
To clone the repository go to your account open this repo and either click on clone button or run the command below to get this repository on your local machine

> git clone <_URL you just copied_>

e.g. git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/first_contribution.git

### Step 4: Create a branch
On your local machine go the project folder that you cloned and use following git command inside that folder

create a new branch using below command.

> git commit -m "resolved the \<issue\>"

### Step 7: Push changes to GitHub
Now we have to push the changes that we made to remote repository on specified branch to do so use command below.

> git push origin \<branch-name\>

name of branch is same as you created in step 4

e.g `git push origin mybranch`

### Step 8: Submit your changes for review
Once you have pushed your code to GitHub, it's now time to create pull request, you will go to the repository click on compare and pull request and submit the pull request.
